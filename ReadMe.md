## Summary 
- **DENTEX Challenge Overview:**
  - The DENTEX challenge was held in 2023 during MICCAI.
  - Its main goal was to develop algorithms for accurately detecting abnormal teeth and providing associated diagnoses on panoramic X-rays, aiding in precise treatment planning and reducing errors.

- **Hierarchically Annotated Data:**
  - The challenge offers three types of annotated data structured using the FDI system.
    1. Partially labeled data with quadrant information.
    2. Partially labeled data with quadrant and enumeration information.
    3. Fully labeled data containing quadrant-enumeration-diagnosis information for each abnormal tooth. All participant algorithms will be evaluated using this data.

- **Purpose of DENTEX:**
  - DENTEX aims to evaluate AI effectiveness in dental radiology analysis and its potential to enhance dental practice by comparing algorithms that identify abnormal teeth with enumeration and diagnosis on panoramic X-rays.
